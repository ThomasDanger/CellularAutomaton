# About
In 2023, I started researching cellular automaton out of personal interest. Here, I have provided a small collection of self-replicating loops and elementary cellular automaton. 
I stopped after remembering this project had minimal bearing on anything useful. Still, I find some portions of my implementation novel including using a hashmap to store keys
for self-replicating loops, allowing extinsibility when provided a conforming rule set. Unfortunately, in the field of self-replicating loops, it appears researchers shifted away
from using the same format their predecessors used, making it difficult and tedious to define rulesets for new rules.

# Background
In highschool, I worked with a small group to create an elementary cellular automaton program in Scratch. Ironically, the Scratch implementation was far more difficult than a Java
implementation. During this project, my group was investigated for and cleared of academic dishonesty charges due to similar projects existing. This project was to prove to myself
that I could recreate a high school project in Java. Unfortunately, this was much easier than I had initially expected, so I implemented it in 3 different languages. This also gave me
a chance to play around with MIPS assembler language, which I love to play around with. Though, I clearly did some malpractice in the Assembler implementation in retrospect.
